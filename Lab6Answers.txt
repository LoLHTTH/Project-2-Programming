1.1 LevelSystem subscribes to the EnInit event.

1.2. The game level number and all the required data for this level is stored in the EnInit.

1.3. The argument is a string of the directory of the background image from the level.
A reference of the string is passed in the BackgroundCreator and is assigned to the m_fileName of the object.
Now the m_fileName contains the string reference of the background image of the level.

1.4. It takes in a reference of type entity and assigns the position and background for the entity.

1.5. A type Position and a type Background is assigned to a Background Entity.

1.6 Vector2f and a bool.
Entity assigns type Tank, type Motion, type Position and type Volume.

1.7 tankBaseEntity is stored in a variable in TurretCreator called m_parentEntity.

1.8 Because we want to make the turret move aswell when the TankBase is moved. If the Turret Entity didn't have a 
Parent component that stores a reference to the TankBase entity, then the turret wouldn't move when the TankBase
has been moved. The Turret needs to keep track of the position of the TankBase as the turret's position is based on
the TankBase's position.
